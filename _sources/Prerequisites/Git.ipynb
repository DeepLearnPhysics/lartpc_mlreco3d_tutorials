    "# Version control with Git\n",
    "\n",
    "If you ever started commenting old code \"just in case\" it turns out to be useful one day in the future,\n",
    "or if you think that sharing a code base between several people is a headache... \n",
    "you need to start using version control. Git is one of the most popular options, and\n",
    "it is the one we use to develop `lartpc_mlreco3d`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Git basics\n",
    "\n",
    "### The jargon\n",
    "```{margin} Basic workflow in short\n",
    "\n",
    "If you work with Git, you code on your local machine for a while. When you have done a meaningful chunk of code changes,\n",
    "you add them to a staging area and commit them. To share with other developers, you push your commit to the remote repository.\n",
    "Other developers can pull your commit from the remote repository. Git can merge your commit into their local repositories.\n",
    "```\n",
    "Repository (repo in short)\n",
    " : the folder that hosts all of your library / code is called a repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "Local vs remote repository\n",
    " : although it is not necessary, usually repositories are hosted on a website such as\n",
    "Github. The repository exists in Github (remote) and on your computer or local machine (local). You can start with\n",
    "a local repository that you use later to create the remote repository, or you can *clone* the remote repository onto your\n",
    "local machine and start working locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Staging area\n",
    " : when you are happy with changes that you made in your working directory, you put the files that you want to be tracked in \n",
    "the so-called staging area. This lets Git know which files to look at to make its snapshot of the code changes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Commit\n",
    " : a snapshot of the changes that you made since the last commit. Git is smart enough to only save the differences.\n",
    " Each commit is identified with a unique hash number that looks like `a97931de9e0be8de3b2910c3339bf29e01ca6fdc`.\n",
    "\n",

    "How Git works in a nutshell.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### `git status`\n",
    "When you want to see which files have changes, which files are in the staging area ready to be committed:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "Singularity> git status\n",
    "On branch master\n",
    "Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Changes not staged for commit:\n",
    "  (use \"git add <file>...\" to update what will be committed)\n",
    "  (use \"git checkout -- <file>...\" to discard changes in working directory)\n",
    "\n",
    "        modified:   _toc.yml\n",
    "\n",
    "Untracked files:\n",
    "  (use \"git add <file>...\" to include in what will be committed)\n",
    "\n",
    "        .ipynb_checkpoints/\n",
    "        \n",
    "no changes added to commit (use \"git add\" and/or \"git commit -a\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### `git add`\n",
    "When you want to add files to be part of the next commit. \n",
    "\n",
    "Use `git add -u` to add all changed files that are tracked (i.e. were part of a previous commit). \n",
    "\n",
    "Use `git add your_file` to add a new file to the staging area.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `git commit`\n",
    "Will take all files in the staging area, compute the changes and store them in a commit.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have to give a title to your commit. Use `git commit -m \"your_message\"` to go fast. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you have more to say than can be said in a title, you optionally can write a whole text\n",
    "body to your commit. Just use `git commit` and it will open a text editor for you. Write your\n",
    "message, save and exit to complete the commit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `git clone`\n",
    "You want to use an existing repository? You need its Git URL.\n",
    "In Github, you click on the green `Code` button to get the repository URL. \n",
    "It will look something like this: `https://github.com/DeepLearnPhysics/lartpc_mlreco3d_tutorials.git`\n",
    "Then you do `git clone YOUR_URL`. This will clone the remote repository into a new folder in your current working directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `git log`\n",
    "Will show you the history of commits.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Working with branches\n",
    "Branches allow you to develop in parallel several versions of the same codebase, and to merge them seamlessly\n",
    "when you decide to. For example, if you want to work on an experimental feature that might break everything,\n",
    "it is easier to fork from the code base, create a new branch and develop the feature there. It allows you to keep\n",
    "evolving the code base in a stable way, fixing minor bugs, sharing with collaborators etc. When your feature is ready\n",
    "then you can merge it back, and voila !\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "### `git checkout`\n",
    "Extremely useful command that allows you to navigate between branches and commits. \n",
    "\n",
    "`git checkout -b my_new_branch` will create a new branch called `my_new_branch`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`git checkout existing_branch` will switch the code in your folder to the branch `existing_branch`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`git checkout a97931de9e0be8de3b2910c3339bf29e01ca6fdc` will switch to the commit whose hash code you provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `git merge`\n",
    "When you are ready, you can merge a branch (local or remote branch) into your current branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use `git merge other_branch` to merge `other_branch` into the current one.\n",
    "\n",
    "If everything is clear to Git, it will proceed to make the merge automatically. There might however be *merge conflicts*\n",
    "which happen when something is ambiguous and Git is unsure which version of the code to keep in a file. It will tell you\n",
    "which files have merge conflicts, and you have to manually open the file, find the problematic code blocks that have been\n",
    "highlighted by Git, and erase what you do not want to keep.\n",
