# Getting started

This is a collection of Jupyter notebooks and tutorials to get you up to speed on [`lartpc_mlreco3d`](https://github.com/DeepLearnPhysics/lartpc_mlreco3d).

If you are not familiar yet with Jupyter, Python, Numpy, or PyTorch, please take a look at the [Prerequisites](./Prerequisites/README.md).

Here is a brief introduction about [our physics research](./Physics/README.md).

A bird's view of the reconstruction chain is [here](./Code/README.md).

There are several [exercises](./Exercises/README.md) that you can do to familiarize yourself further with `lartpc_mlreco3d`.
