# Neutrinos

With fancy machine learning algorithms and LArTPC detectors, what are we actually looking for? Neutrinos? That sounds cute, but what is it about exactly?

## Neutrinos in particle physics

### Think tiny, tiny particles
You will also meet people who call it `high energy physics` or `hep` in short. What is our universe made of? Why is there matter around us? Particle physics is a field of physics that tries to answer these questions by studying the smallest and irreducible (i.e. that cannot be broken down into smaller particles, as far as we know) `particles` and their interactions, often called `fundamental interactions`.


```{margin} Example
A hydrogen atom is the simplest possible atom. It contains 1 proton, 1 electron, 1 neutron.

Most of you have probably heard of atoms and molecules in high school. For example, water is made of `H2O` molecules. `H2O` is made of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. So, you were told that matter around you is made of various atoms. What is in these atoms? It turns out that an atom can be smashed down into a bunch of three smaller particles: protons (positively charged), electrons (negatively charged) and neutrons (as the name suggests, neutral charge). Protons and neutrons are stuck together and form the nucleus of the atom. Think of electrons as a cloud orbiting around the nucleus. 

Is that it? For the electron, yes. Electrons are fundamental particles. However you can in turn break down protons and neutrons into `quarks`. And that is where our knowledge stops. As far as we know, quarks are irreducible particles.

### Fundamental interactions
You probably have heard that the gravitational force is what keeps you bounded to the Earth and keeps you from flying like a bird (unfortunately). It also keeps planets of our solar system orbiting around the Sun (pretty important). Gravitation is one of the four fundamental interactions. The other one that we have all encountered is the electromagnetic force. 
* The strong force (holds the protons and neutrons together to make the nucleus of an atom)
* The electromagnetic force (interaction between charges)
* The weak force
* The gravitational force

### So... I still don't know what neutrinos are.

## How do we know that neutrinos even exist?
Excellent question! Before LArTPC were even invented, there were smart experimenters who figured out various ways to prove the existence of neutrinos and start studying their properties. 

### Are neutrinos real?
Neutrinos were theorized in the 1930s starting with Wolfgang Pauli, Enrico Fermi and various other theoretical physicists. But their ghost existence was not proven until the Reines and Cowan experiment in 1956, after which they sent a telegram to Pauli: “We are happy to inform you that we have definitively detected neutrinos.”

### How many neutrinos are there, really?
Muon and tau neutrinos discoveries

### Anomalies
Solar & atmospheric anomalies -> neutrino oscillation

### The galaxy hitchhikers
Supernova neutrinos detection
IceCube & blazar neutrinos

## So we know everything about neutrinos, right?
Not quite. Believe it or not, we still cannot figure out the absolute mass of neutrinos, nor which one is the lighter (dubbed the `hierarchy problem`). Actually, our Standard Model predicts that the neutrino should NOT have a mass, so this in itself is interesting.

Are neutrinos their own antiparticles? (We call such particles, which are their own antiparticles, `Majorana particles`)
Why is there matter rather than anti-matter in the universe?
